    "summary": "\"Bombtrack\" is the song by Rage Against the Machine that opens their self-titled debut album. Like most all of Rage Against the Machine's songs, the song's lyrics discuss social inequality, proclaiming that \"landlords and power whores\" were going to \"burn\". The intro riff was composed by Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello when he was playing with the band Lock Up, and, upon hearing it, they told him it was too \"heavy\". The main riff is one composed by Funkadelic, for Alice In My Fantasies. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine/_/Bombtrack\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
