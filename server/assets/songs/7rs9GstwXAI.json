    "summary": "“Chop Suey!“ is the first single from American heavy metal band System of a Down's second album Toxicity. The single was released in September 2001 and earned the band its first Grammy nomination. The song's working title was \"Suicide\"; the band members claim the change was not caused by pressure from their record company. The words \"We're rolling Suicide\" can still be heard faintly in the album versions's opening seconds - though this intro is only on certain pressings of the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/_/Chop+Suey%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
