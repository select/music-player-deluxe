    "summary": "\"Born Slippy\" is a single by Underworld, originally released in 1995 and has never appeared on an album by the group. The track is instrumental and features no lyrics. Despite this, it is often confused with the more popular vocal track, \"Born Slippy .NUXX\", because of the similar name. However, they are completely different in composition and sound. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Underworld/_/Born+Slippy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
