    "summary": "Dougan frequently attempts different variations of the same track, which usually find their way onto single releases. However the Kurayamino variation of this Clubbed to Death is significantly better known than the first one due to its appearance in the film The Matrix. Therefore, this version is now known simply as Clubbed to Death, and the first one as the First Mix.\nThe subtitle Kurayamino variation is Japanese for darkness's variation (暗闇（くらやみ） kurayami means darkness, and の no is the genitive suffix). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Dougan/_/Clubbed+to+Death\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
