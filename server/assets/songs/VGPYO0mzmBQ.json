    "summary": "\"This is the story of Isobel; she was born in a forest by a spark, and as she grew up, she realized that the pebbles on the forest floor were actually skyscrapers. And by the time she was a grown-up woman and the skyscrapers had taken over the forest. She found herself in a city, and she didn't like all the people there so much, because they were a bit too clever for her.\"\n\nIsobel was written by Björk, Nellee Hooper and Marius De Vries, and the lyrics were made by Sjón - his very first songlyric in fact. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/_/Isobel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
