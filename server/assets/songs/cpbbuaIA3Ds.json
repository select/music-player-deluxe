    "summary": "\"Money\" is a song from British progressive rock band Pink Floyd's 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". It is the only song on the album to hit the top 20 in the United States charts. On the original LP, it opened the second side of the album. It was written by Roger Waters. The guitar solo is ranked number 62 on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\n\"Money\" is notable for its introductory passage of cash registers dinging and coins clinking, much like \"Time\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Money\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
