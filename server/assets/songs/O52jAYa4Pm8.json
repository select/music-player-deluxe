    "summary": "\"Psycho Killer\" is a song by Talking Heads from their 1977 album \"Talking Heads: 77\", written by David Byrne, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. The band's \"signature debut hit\" features lyrics which seem to represent the thoughts of a serial killer. AllMusic calls it a \"deceptively funky New Wave/No Wave song ... [with] an insistent rhythm, and one of the most memorable, driving bass lines in rock & roll.\"\n\n\"Psycho Killer\" was the only song from the album to appear on the Billboard charts, peaking at 92 among Billboard Pop Singles. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads/_/Psycho+Killer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
