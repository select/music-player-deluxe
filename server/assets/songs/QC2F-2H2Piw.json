    "summary": "'Citizen Erased' is the sixth track from Muse's second studio album 'Origin of Symmetry'.  At 7 minutes 21 seconds, it is the longest song on the album.\n\nThe song was first played live on the 12th February 2001, and the guitar intro was originally played on keyboard.  The piano outro was introduced around April 2001, and a different riff in the solo section was introduced during the Absolution tour.  The song is enormously popular among Muse's fan base, but is still fairly rare inclusion in recent Muse sets. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Citizen+Erased\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
