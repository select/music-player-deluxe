    "summary": "Rateliff has said the song is about drinking one's life away after a break-up, and that the lyrics are based on his personal experience with delirium tremens during alcohol withdrawal. He also described it as a \"joke song\" and said that originally his band didn't plan to record it, but due to positive reception, did so and released it as a single.  The music video was released on July 15, 2015.  It was directed and edited by Greg Barnes, and produced by Melissa Giles. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nathaniel+Rateliff+&+the+Night+Sweats/_/S.O.B.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
