    "summary": "\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" is a song by The Beatles from the 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as The White Album).\nThe song opens with a flamenco guitar solo (taken from a seldom-heard Mellotron bank of Spanish guitar runs; on some CD reissues, this solo closes the previous track, \"Wild Honey Pie\"), followed by the chorus, sung by all four Beatles, Ringo's then-wife Maureen, and Yoko Ono (providing the only female lead vocal on a Beatles recording, for a single line). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/The+Continuing+Story+of+Bungalow+Bill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
