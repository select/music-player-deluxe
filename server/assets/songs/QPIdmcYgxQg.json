  "lastfmSummary": "\"Helicopter\" is a song by British indie rock band Bloc Party. It was first released as a single from their 2004 EP Little Thoughts on October 25, 2004 in Europe and released again on February 21, 2006 in the US.\n\nIt was rumored to be about George W. Bush being elected president of U.S.A., but the band has denied this, with lead singer Kele Okereke telling press it was partially about himself.\n\nThere are two videos for the song. A European video was produced, filmed in black and white, featuring shaky and fuzzy shots. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/_/Helicopter\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
