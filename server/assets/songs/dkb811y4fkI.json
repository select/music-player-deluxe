    "summary": "“One of These Nights” is a song by American rock band Eagles, released in May 1975 as the title track and lead single from their fourth studio album One of These Nights. Written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey, the song became one of the band’s biggest hits, blending rock, soul, and disco influences into their signature West Coast sound.\n\nBackground\nFollowing the success of their earlier country-rock hits, Eagles shifted toward a more polished, mainstream rock sound on One of These Nights. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eagles/_/One+of+These+Nights\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
