    "summary": "“Sleeping Satellite” was Archer’s first major release and served as a striking introduction to her soulful voice and thoughtful songwriting. The song reflects on the moon landings of the late 1960s, questioning whether humanity’s focus on technological achievement came at the expense of nurturing the Earth and its people.\n\nArcher has described the song as both a celebration of human achievement and a subtle critique of misplaced priorities, blending personal reflection with broader social commentary. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tasmin+Archer/_/Sleeping+Satellite\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
