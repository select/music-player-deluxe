    "summary": "\"We're All to Blame\" is the first single from Chuck by Sum 41. The band has stated that the song is about the \"state of the world due to war, people dying, people living in fear, and the power of corporations, amongst other concerns.\"\n\nThe song is one of the most critically acclaimed Sum 41 singles. It was written after their trip to the Congo, making it the last song written for Chuck (\"Noots\" was originally going to be track 3 on the album, but was cut right after \"We're All To Blame\" was recorded). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sum+41/_/We%27re+All+to+Blame\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
