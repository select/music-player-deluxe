Directly after this, a lengthy guitar solo is performed by Frank Zappa and a repeat of the chorus with backing vocals from Captain Beefheart.\n\nThe song closes the album, as well as the compilation Strictly Commercial, and was also used as a finale in concerts for many years afterwards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa/_/Muffin+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
