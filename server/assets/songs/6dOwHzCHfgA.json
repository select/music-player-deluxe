    "summary": "\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\" is a power ballad written by Nick Van Eede and performed by his band, Cutting Crew. It was their biggest hit, peaking at #1 in the United States, Canada and Norway, and reaching the Top Five in the UK, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland.\nThe words \"I just died in your arms tonight\" originally came to Van Eede while he was having sex with his girlfriend, \"death\" being an often-used metaphor for orgasm. Writing down the phrase, Van Eede later used it as the hook to \"(I Just) Died In Your Arms.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cutting+Crew/_/(I+Just)+Died+in+Your+Arms\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
