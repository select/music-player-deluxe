    "summary": "\"Help!\" is a song by The Beatles that served as the title song for both the album Help! and the film Help!. It was also released as a single, and was #1 for three weeks in both the UK and USA. \"Help!\" was written primarily by John Lennon, but credited (as all Beatles song written by either person) to Lennon/McCartney. Paul McCartney reports that he had a hand in writing the song as well, being called in \"to complete it\" in a two-hour joint writing session at Lennon's house. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Help%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
