    "summary": "“We met him a few years back, he was always an mythical legend for us, a bit mysterious. His personal life path follows the music. The idea behind the track was to make a sort of documentary based on an interview we did with him. Giorgio Moroder’s voice was recorded with different microphones from different periods. We finally ended with over three hours worth of interview material in which he recalls his life as a musician. This track is a great metaphore on musical freedom. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/_/Giorgio+by+Moroder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
