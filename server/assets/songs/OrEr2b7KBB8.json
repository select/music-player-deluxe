    "summary": "“Right Down The Line” is a single released off of Gerry’s album City To City, following his massively successful single “Bakers Street.”\n\n“Right Down The Line” has a much different sound than “Bakers Street” despite it being the next single released by Rafferty. “Right Down The Line” is a more mellow song that describes how Gerry feels about his lover (at the time of the release of this song, Gerry was married to his wife Carla Ventilla). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gerry+Rafferty/_/Right+Down+The+Line\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
