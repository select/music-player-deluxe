    "summary": "This song is about sexual morality, with Wainwright asking his lover, \"Am I only the one you love?\" Note the position of the word \"only,\" which has a different meaning if stated, \"Am I the only one you love?\"\n\nWainwright's sister Martha, one of a handful of musicians in the family, added backing vocals to this track, and Levon Helm of The Band played drums on it. The album was recorded at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, which is where Helm lived. He had recently fought off throat cancer and was happy to go back to work. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright/_/The+One+You+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
