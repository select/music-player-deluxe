    "summary": "\"Ovule\" is a deeply introspective and contemplative exploration of love, loss, and the complex nature of human relationships. The lyrics describe the image of a glass egg suspended in a dark, blood-red void, which represents a metaphorical space where the two lovers can exist together in perfect harmony and unity.\n\nThe glass egg is a symbol of purity and fragility, representing the delicate balance that exists between the two lovers, and the need to protect and cherish their bond. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/_/Ovule\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
