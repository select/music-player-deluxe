    "summary": "Much like \"Welcome To The Machine,\" this song is about corporations and how they control their musicians. The line, \"We call it riding the gravy train\" is held for such a long time to emphasize the fact that these companies will go as long as possible to squeeze every last cent out of their clients. Vocals on the studio recording of this track were contributed by British folk singer Roy Harper, who was in the Abbey Road studios while Wish You Were Here was being recorded. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Have+a+Cigar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
