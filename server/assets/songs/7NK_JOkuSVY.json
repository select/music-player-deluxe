    "summary": "Lost is a song by American rock band Linkin Park. Lost was originally finished for the band's second studio album, Meteora, being mixed and mastered for inclusion, but ultimately cut in favor of a song with similar structure and tone, Numb.\n\nLost was known for years within the Linkin Park fan community as \"Thoughts That Take Away My Pride\". On The Making of Meteora DVD, fans noticed  a five second clip of Chester singing \"thoughts that take away my pride, trapped in places deep inside\" over an instrumental. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/_/Lost\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
