    "summary": "\"Objection\" is the first song written by Shakira purely in English. It appears as the opening track on her first English language album, \"Laundry Service.\"  The song contains a rhythm which is quite similar to the Uruguayan-Argentinian tango \"La Cumparsita\". The song starts out as a classical tango with allusions to La Cumparsita, with a piano, accompanied by a contrabass, and a bandoneon. However, when the drums join in, it turns more into a latin rock song, with two e-guitars, and bass. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Shakira/_/Objection+(Tango)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
