    "summary": "The song was used in the 1983 film Flashdance and was inspired by the 1980 horror film Maniac. The film Maniac was about a serial killer who stalks his victims in New York City. The song's performer and co-writer Michael Sembello recalls that an early version of the chorus was:\n\nHe's a maniac, maniac that's for sure, \nHe will kill your cat and nail him to the door. \nAt the suggestion of the record's producer Phil Ramone, the lyrics were rewritten to describe a girl with a passion for dancing. The lyrics became: <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Sembello/_/Maniac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
