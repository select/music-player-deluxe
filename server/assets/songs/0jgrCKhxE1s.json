The main reason for its popularity is its inclusion in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Immediately after it was included in the game, DragonForce's record sales shot up by 126% in the following week. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DragonForce/_/Through+the+Fire+and+Flames\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
