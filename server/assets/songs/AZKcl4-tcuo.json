    "summary": "\"Life on Mars?\" is a song by David Bowie first released in 1971 on the album Hunky Dory and also released as a single. The song—which BBC Radio 2 later called \"a cross between a Broadway musical and a Salvador Dalí painting\"—featured guest piano work by keyboardist Rick Wakeman. When released as a single in 1973, it reached #3 in the UK and stayed on the chart for thirteen weeks. The song re-entered the UK charts at #55 over 30 years later, largely because of its use in the original British television series Life on Mars.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Life+on+Mars%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
