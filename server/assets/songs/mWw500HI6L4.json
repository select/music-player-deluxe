Over the years the band saw a bunch of line-up changes and developed the sound which basically is a blend of garage/fuzz rock and spacey trips in combination with a lightshow concept when playing live.\n\nThe band soon started playing gigs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Liquid+Visions/_/Pink+Cloud\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
