    "summary": "“Jumpsuit” is one of two singles released to promote Twenty One Pilots' fifth album, Trench; the other being “Nico And The Niners.” The single was first scheduled to premiere in some radio stations in the US but was instead released 30 minutes before that on iTunes and YouTube respectively.\n\nThe song’s music style is characterized by the contrast between its heavy rock feel and the generally restrained vocals. It also makes frequent use of voice modulation and other synthetic sounds. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Twenty+One+Pilots/_/Jumpsuit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
