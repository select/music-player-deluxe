  "lastfmSummary": "\"The Loop\" is Toro y Moi's third single from his seventh studio album, MAHAL. The song is a psychedelic funk jam with a slow-strolling bassline and a quietly assured sense of swagger. Chaz Bear sings the song in a mellow, airy tenor, like a supremely stoned Pharrell Williams if he was impersonating Rivers Cuomo. The video, credited to Bear’s Company Studio outfit, is a fun hang, with Bear and friends rolling through San Francisco on jeepneys and skateboards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Toro+y+Moi/_/The+Loop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
