    "summary": "On “CrasH,” Q delivers a smooth flow over laid-back production from Boi-1da. Q discusses more serious topics of his life, including his family, wealth, and former life of crime. He recognizes that he must find a balance among all the aspects of his life to overcome his unresolved issues and have some peace of mind.\n\n“CrasH” is the third and final pre-release single from CrasH Talk. The song samples Royce da 5'9\"’s 1999 single, “Boom,” which was produced by DJ Premier. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/ScHoolboy+Q/_/CrasH\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
