    "summary": "War Pigs\" is a song by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath from their 1970 album Paranoid. It is generally understood that the song is a protest against the Vietnam War; however, when the band played \"War Pigs\" live in the mid-1970s, scenes from World War II were projected for audiences.\n\nAs explained in the liner notes of the band's live album Reunion, the original title of the song was \"Walpurgis\", dealing with a witches' sabbath. The title, lyrics, and theme were subsequently changed during the recording of Paranoid. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/_/War+Pigs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
