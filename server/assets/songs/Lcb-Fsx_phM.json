    "summary": "\"Urgent\" is a song by the English-American rock band Foreigner, and the first single from their album 4 in 1981. Foreigner went into the studio with producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, best known at the time as producer of hard rock band AC/DC. Foreigner's sound wasn't quite as heavy, and the band worked with then-unknown Thomas Dolby to program and play synthesizer. Dolby's work can be heard on \"Urgent\", along with a saxophone solo by Motown great Junior Walker. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foreigner/_/Urgent\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
