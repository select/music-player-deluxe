    "summary": "\"Fly Like an Eagle\" is a song written by Steve Miller on the album Fly Like an Eagle. The song went to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the week of January 8, 1977. The single edit can be found on Greatest Hits (1974–1978). The song has an unusually mellow and \"dreamy\" feel. It is usually played in tandem with \"Space Intro\".\n\nAn earlier 1973 version of the song features a more bluesy and less funk-inspired rhythm, and guitar taking the synthesizer parts (albeit with similar delay effects). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Miller+Band/_/Fly+Like+an+Eagle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
