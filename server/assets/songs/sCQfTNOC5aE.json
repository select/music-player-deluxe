    "summary": "\"In a Sentimental Mood\" is a jazz composition by Duke Ellington. He composed the piece in 1935 and recorded it with his orchestra during the same year. Lyrics were written by Manny Kurtz; Ellington's manager Irving Mills gave himself a percentage of the publishing, so the song was credited to all three. Other popular versions in 1935/36 were by Benny Goodman and by Mills Blue Rhythm Band. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington/_/In+A+Sentimental+Mood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
