    "summary": "\"Ooh La La\" is a Faces song, written by Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood. It was Ronnie Wood, not Rod Stewart or Ronnie Lane, who sang the lead vocal for this song. Lane and Stewart were at odds at the time. Stewart did not think the song was up to his standards although both he and Lane recorded lead vocals for it. Their producer suggested Wood give it a try, and that's the version that was used for the album, which was Faces last studio album. Lane left the group after Ooh La La was released and Faces disbanded after their 1974 tour. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Faces/_/Ooh+La+La\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
