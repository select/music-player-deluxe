    "summary": "\"Dig a Pony\" is a song by The Beatles, originally released on their 1970 album Let It Be. \"Dig a Pony\" was the penultimate song played at the concert on the rooftop of Apple Studios in Savile Row, London on 30 January 1969.\nJohn Lennon was the song's composer and singer but the song was credited to Lennon/McCartney. It was originally called \"All I Want Is You\". Lennon would later comment that he thought the song was \"a piece of garbage,\"[1] though he has shown similar scorn for many of his songs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Dig+a+Pony\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
