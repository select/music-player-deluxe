    "summary": "This is a combination of 2 songs: \"Guns Of Brixton\" by The Clash and \"Just Be Good To Me\" by The S.O.S. Band.\n\nIn 1990 vocalist Lindy Laytons came up with the idea to do a cover of SOS's band's 1984 hit \"Just Be Good To Me.\" She knew it would go well with other beats because she'd tried it as a DJ. She used the bassline from The Clash song \"Guns Of Brixton,\" which was her tipping off her hat to The Clash as she was such a big fan. She also wanted to do something slower than house music, yet something funky you could get into to. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Beats+International/_/Dub+Be+Good+To+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
