    "summary": "Ne Me Quitte Pas was written by Jacques Brel in 1959 and made its first appearance as a recorded version the same year on his album La Valse à mille temps.\n\nThe song refers to Brel and his lover Suzanne Gabriello separating, although, contrary to what the song's lyrics imply, it was actually him who initiated the separation.\n\nIn its original version the song features the Ondes Martenot, an early and rather rare electronic musical instrument. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jacques+Brel/_/Ne+me+quitte+pas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
