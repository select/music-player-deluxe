    "summary": "\"Carry the Zero\" is a song recorded by the American rock band Built to Spill for their fourth studio album, Keep It Like a Secret. It was released as the second single from Keep It Like a Secret in 1999 through Warner Bros. Records. An extended play of the same name was released the same year; it is their first solo EP after the 1995 split EP Built to Spill Caustic Resin.\n\n\"Carry the Zero\" is perhaps considered the band's most popular song. In \"Carry the Zero\", Martsch \"extends a mathematical metaphor\" to depict a disaffected relationship. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Built+to+Spill/_/Carry+the+Zero\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
