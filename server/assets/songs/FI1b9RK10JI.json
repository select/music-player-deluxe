    "summary": "The inspiration for \"Águas de Março\" came from Rio de Janeiro's rainiest month. March is typically marked by sudden storms with heavy rains and strong winds that cause flooding in many places around the city. The lyrics and the music have a constant downward progression much like the water torrent from those rains flowing in the gutters, which typically would carry sticks, stones, bits of glass, and almost everything and anything.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elis+Regina/_/%C3%81guas+De+Mar%C3%A7o\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
