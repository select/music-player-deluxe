    "summary": "\"We like to call this style of our music 'Cybermetal.' 'Zero' has six rhythm guitars, with two line-in 12-string acoustics, plus those wacky James Iha leads. Tracked live with overdubs added later, this is a true mover as well as the first song that was recorded for Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness, James has always said this reminds him of Judas Priest.\" -Billy Corgan (Guitar World 1/97) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smashing+Pumpkins/_/Zero\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
