  "lastfmSummary": "\"Rasputin\" is a 1978 Euro-disco hit single by the Germany-based pop and euro disco group Boney M., the second from their album Nightflight to Venus. The song is a semi-biographical song about Grigori Rasputin, a friend and advisor of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his family during the early 20th century. The song variously sensationalizes Rasputin as a playboy, mystical healer, and political demiurge. The tune of the song is based on Turkish song Kâtibim. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Boney+M./_/Rasputin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
