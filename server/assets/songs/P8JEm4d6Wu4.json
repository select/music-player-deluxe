    "summary": "\"Insomnia\" is a song produced by british trip-hop/dance band Faithless. It was released in November 1995 as their second single and it soon became succesful, peaking at #27 in the UK dance charts in 1995 and #3 in 1996. It also showed its longevity when it reached #48 as a re-entry in 2005.\nThe version featured in the original album is nearly nine minutes long and contained some bells ringing at the start, usually unknown to clubbers, who were used to listening to the Monster Remix of the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Faithless/_/Insomnia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
