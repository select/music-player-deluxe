    "summary": "\"Troy\" is a song written and recorded by Sinéad O'Connor, the first single from her 1987 debut album, The Lion and the Cobra. \n\nThe song uses the story of the ancient city of Troy as a metaphor. The lyric \"Being what you are, there is no other Troy for you to burn\" is a reference to the poem \"No Second Troy\" by William Butler Yeats (\"Why, what could she have done being what she is?/Was there another Troy for her to burn?\")\n\nThe video featured O'Connor <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sin%C3%A9ad+O%27Connor/_/Troy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
