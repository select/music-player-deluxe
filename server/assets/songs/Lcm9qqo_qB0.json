    "summary": "The seventh track from the influential \"Rust in Peace\" album, \"Tornado of Souls\" is a fan-favourite and is played at live shows regularly.  Its guitar solo is considered  to be one of lead guitarist Marty Friedman's best guitar solos.\n\n\"'Tornado of Souls' is about me getting out of a dysfunctional relationship. It has nothing to do with killing anybody.\" (Mustaine, 1993)\n\n\"When I finished the solo to this one, Mustaine came into the studio, listened to it down once, turned around and without saying a word, shook my hand. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Megadeth/_/Tornado+of+Souls\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
