    "summary": "The first song we ever wrote as Khruangbin was a song called \"August 12,\" off our debut album. It's a really meaningful song for us, and we wanted something of the spirit of it to come with us into this second album. So we listened to it backwards, learned to play it in reverse, then added a few new ideas into it that reflected who we are as a band now.\n\nWe recorded it nearly exactly six years later, and it's become this connective tissue between the two records, a kind of reminder to us about how far we've come together. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Khruangbin/_/August+10\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
