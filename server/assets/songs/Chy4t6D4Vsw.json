    "summary": "\"Lights\" is a song by English recording artist Ellie Goulding from Bright Lights (2010), the reissue of her debut album, Lights (2010). Written by Goulding, Richard Stannard and Ash Howes, the song was inspired by Goulding's childhood fear of the dark. It was released in the United Kingdom on 13 March 2011 as the album's sixth single overall, and second from Bright Lights. Originally a bonus track on the iTunes edition of Lights, the song was re-edited for inclusion on Bright Lights in late 2010, serving as the single version. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ellie+Goulding/_/Lights\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
