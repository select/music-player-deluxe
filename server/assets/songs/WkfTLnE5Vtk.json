    "summary": "\"The Ghetto\" is a socially conscious, mostly instrumental funk/soul anthem, released as the first single off American soul singer Donny Hathaway's debut album, Everything Is Everything, released as a single in 1970 on Atlantic Records.\n\nThe song was co-written by Hathaway and Leroy Hutson. The song was a six minute and fifty second workout which built upon a cinematic feel with its lengthy instrumental though it did feature vocal ad-libs from Hathaway <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Donny+Hathaway/_/The+Ghetto\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
