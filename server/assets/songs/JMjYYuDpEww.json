    "summary": "\"White Rabbit\" was written by Grace Slick, who based the lyrics on Lewis Carroll's book Alice In Wonderland. Like many young musicians in San Francisco, Slick did a lot of drugs. She saw lots of drug references in Carroll's book, including the pills, the smoking caterpillar, the mushroom, and lots of other images that are generally trippy. She noticed that lots of childrens stories involve a substance of some kind that alters reality, and felt it was time to write a song about it. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane/_/White+Rabbit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
