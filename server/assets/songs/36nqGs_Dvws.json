    "summary": "Seaside Rendezvous\", written by Mercury, is probably best known for the \"musical\" bridge section which begins at around 0:51 into the song. The section is performed entirely by Mercury and Taylor using their voices alone. Mercury imitates woodwind instruments including a clarinet and Taylor mostly brass instruments, including tubas and trumpets, and even a kazoo. The tap dance segment is also \"performed\" by Mercury and Taylor on the mixing desk with thimbles on their fingers. Mercury plays both grand piano and jangle honky-tonk. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Seaside+Rendezvous\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
