    "summary": "\"Why\", by Carly Simon, was one of a string of film-inspired singles from a less successful period in her career (specifically in the US). Following her much publicized break-down on stage in 1980, it was recorded for the movie Soup for One in 1982. The movie flopped but the soundtrack was a success.\n\nThe song, like all of the soundtrack, was produced by Edwards & Rodgers of Chic fame. This was a move away from the usual guitar-based hits of Simon's past. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Carly+Simon/_/Why\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
