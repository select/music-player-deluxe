    "summary": "\"Many Rivers to Cross\" is a song written in 1969 by Jimmy Cliff.\n\nSong information\n\nThis is one of the few Cliff tracks to use an organ, which helps to supplement the gospel feel provided by the backing vocalists. Cliff released the song, with production work by Leslie Kong, on his 1969 album, Jimmy Cliff. It was also released on the 1972 soundtrack album for the film The Harder They Come, in which Cliff also starred as an actor. Rolling Stone ranked it #317 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Cliff/_/Many+Rivers+to+Cross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
