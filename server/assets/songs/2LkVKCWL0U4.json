    "summary": "Fall Out Boy released an updated version of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” his No. 1 hit single from 1989 that runs down a list of proper nouns ripped from the historic headlines. The band attempts to pick up where Joel left off by referencing moments from 1989 to 2023. Among other events, the new lyrics mention Rodney King, deep fakes, Twilight, Michael Jackson, Kim Jong-un, Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, Meghan Markle, George Floyd, 9/11, Fyre Festival, the assassination of Shinzo Abe, and Brexit. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Out+Boy/_/We+Didn%E2%80%99t+Start+the+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
