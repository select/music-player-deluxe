    "summary": "\"Spellbound\" is a song recorded by English rock band Siouxsie & the Banshees in 1981. The track was written by the Banshees and co-produced with Nigel Gray. It was the first single released from the Banshees' fourth album Juju.\n\n\"Spellbound\" is most notable for the strong drumming rhythm that carries the song, courtesy of Budgie, who had recently joined the band as their new percussionist. The single peaked at number twenty-two on the UK singles chart in 1981. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees/_/Spellbound\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
