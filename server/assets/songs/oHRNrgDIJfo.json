    "summary": "\"Feeling Good\" is a powerful and iconic Feeling Good performed by Nina Simone, released on her 1965 I Put a Spell on You. The song was originally written by English composers Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse for the 1964 musical \"The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd\". Interestingly, while the musical itself had a relatively modest run on Broadway, this particular song would go on to become one of its most enduring legacies.\n\nNina Simone's rendition of Feeling Good has become one of her most famous and beloved recordings. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Simone/_/Feeling+Good\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
