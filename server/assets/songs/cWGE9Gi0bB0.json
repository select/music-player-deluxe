    "summary": "\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I–V)\" is the opening suite of Pink Floyd’s ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here, released on September 12, 1975. This epic progressive rock composition is both a sonic masterpiece and a poignant tribute to the band’s former frontman, Syd Barrett, whose deteriorating mental health led to his departure from the group in 1968.\n\nSpanning over 13 minutes in its first half, the piece is divided into five movements (Parts I–V), later followed by Parts VI–IX to bookend the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Shine+On+You+Crazy+Diamond+(Pts.+1-5)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
