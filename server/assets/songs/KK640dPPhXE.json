    "summary": "\"Ma and Pa\" is a song by American ska and funk metal band Fishbone. It was the second single released from the album Truth and Soul. The song only managed to chart in the UK, but remains a fan favorite and a staple of the band's live shows to the present day.\n\nThe song's upbeat ska-based melody stands in direct contrast to its stark lyrical content which relates the story of a married couple's divorce difficulties as they fight for custody over their daughter. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fishbone/_/Ma+and+Pa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
