    "summary": "“So Lonely” was The Police’s first fusing of punk and reggae that would become not only a pioneering new sound in rock, but also their signature sound. It was the band’s third single, the last from their debut album, peaking at #6 in the UK and #7 in Ireland.\n\nIts lyrics were taken from “Fool In Love”, a song from Sting’s previous band Last Exit. Its chorus, Sting has admitted, is a sped-up reinterpretation of Bob Marley’s “No Woman No Cry”. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/_/So+Lonely\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
