    "summary": "This song is about corporate greed and political corruption, culminating in environmental degradation. Together with “War,” “Blood // Water” boosted grandson’s popularity to what it has become today.\n\nThis song and grandson himself were further exposed to a wider audience when it was featured in Episode 21 of Season 2 (“Judgment Night”) of the insanely-popular teen drama show Riverdale. It was also the theme for NXT Takeover: Brooklyn 4, which further increased its popularity. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/grandson/_/Blood+%2F%2F+Water\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
