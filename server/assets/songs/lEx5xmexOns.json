    "summary": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a song written by Freddie Mercury and originally recorded by the band Queen for their 1975 album A Night at the Opera.\n\nThe song is in the style of a stream-of-consciousness nightmare, and has unusual musical structure for popular music (it has no chorus, instead consisting of seemingly disjointed sections including operatic segments, an a cappella and a hard rock part) which works beyond the range of this reviewer. Despite this, it was released as a single and became a huge commercial success.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Bohemian+Rhapsody\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
