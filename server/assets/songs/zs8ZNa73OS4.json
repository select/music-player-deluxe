The song featured a series of car horns, during the instrumental bridge, starting with a Volkswagen Beetle horn, and ending up with a jackhammer sound, in order to give the impressions of the sounds of the summer in the city. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Lovin%27+Spoonful/_/Summer+in+the+City\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
