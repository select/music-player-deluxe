  "lastfmSummary": "\"Megalomaniac\" is a song by American alternative rock band Incubus, from their 2004 album A Crow Left of the Murder. It was released as a single in December of 2003, and eventually reached the top of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, where it stayed for a six-week period.\nContents\n\n\nMusical qualities\n\nThe song begins with a cyclic, scratchy warble that lasts about 30 seconds before fading into a more traditional build. The entire build lasts about one minute in all before climaxing into an electric bass riff, then leading into the first verse. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Incubus/_/Megalomaniac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
