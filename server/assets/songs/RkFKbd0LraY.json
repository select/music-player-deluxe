It samples Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love by Van Halen and reached #7 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe opening verses (\"Lets go back to the rock [...] And see it at four-forty\") are a play on words based on an exact quote (and actual sample) taken from the 1971 movie The Andromeda Strain. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Apollo+440/_/Ain%27t+Talkin%27+%27Bout+Dub\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
