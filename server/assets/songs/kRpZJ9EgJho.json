    "summary": "\"Simple Kind of Life\" is a pop rock ballad written by Gwen Stefani for No Doubt's fourth album Return of Saturn. The song contrasts Stefani's desire to settle down and start a family with her commitment to the band. It received positive reviews from music critics, who noted the song's somber melody and raw lyrics.\n\n\"Simple Kind of Life\" was released as the album's third single in June 2000. It became the most successful American single from Return of Saturn, but had little international success. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt/_/Simple+Kind+of+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
