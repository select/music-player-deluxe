    "summary": "Loosely based on Quincy Jones's classic cut Summer in the City, this is the last in a series of variations on a theme appearing on Nightmares on Wax albums, beginning with Nights Interlude on A Word of Science and continued with Nights Introlude on Smoker's Delight. While the strings on the first part of the series were sampled from Jones's track directly, the \"strings\" on the second part were played on a synthesizer and those on the third part of the series (this track) were played by an actual string orchestra. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nightmares+on+Wax/_/Les+Nuits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
