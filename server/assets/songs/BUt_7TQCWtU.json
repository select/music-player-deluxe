    "summary": "Brian May wrote \"Brighton Rock\" in 1973 with the intention of the song being included on Queen II, but as Queen was unable to  record the song for their second album, it was included on their third album Sheer Heart Attack. \n\nThe title is something of a pun: Brighton rock is a long, cylindrical sugar candy traditional to that seaside resort. The term was also iconic in UK pop culture as the title of a dark Graham Greene thriller/noir novel later adapted into a successful film starring Richard Attenborough as a teenage sociopath.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Brighton+Rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
