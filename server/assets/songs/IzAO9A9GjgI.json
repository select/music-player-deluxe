    "summary": "\"Live to Tell\" is the lead single from Madonna's third studio album, True Blue (1986).\n\nOriginally composed by Patrick Leonard for the score of the film Fire with Fire, the instrumental was shown to Madonna, who decided to use it for then-husband Sean Penn's film At Close Range. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, co-composed the melodies and co-produced it with Leonard.\n\nA pop ballad, the song includes instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna/_/Live+to+Tell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
