    "summary": "\"Black Betty\" (Roud 11668) is a 20th century African-American work song often credited to Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter as the author, though the earliest recordings are not by him. Some sources claim it is one of Lead Belly's many adaptations of earlier folk material; in this case an 18th century marching cadence about a flint-lock rifle.\n\nIn 1977, the rock band Ram Jam — whose members included Bill Bartlett, formerly of Starstruck and The Lemon Pipers — rerecorded the song with producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz under Epic Records. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ram+Jam/_/Black+Betty\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
