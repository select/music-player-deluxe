  "lastfmSummary": "\"I Miss You\" is the second single from Blink-182's 2003 self titled album. It was released in February 2004. The song signals a drastic departure from Blink-182's usual upbeat, crudely humorous style, presenting a somber theme and a slower pace. In the music video, the band plays at a haunted mansion. The video was also featured on their Greatest Hits album.\nThe song reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and peaked at number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/blink-182/_/I+Miss+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
