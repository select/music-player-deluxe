    "summary": "This song was written by the team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, and first recorded by Big Mama Thornton in 1952. In an interview, Leiber explained:\n\n\"Hound Dog' took like twelve minutes. That’s not a complicated piece of work. But the rhyme scheme was difficult. Also, the metric structure of the music was not easy.\"\n\n“Hound Dog” later gained more commercial success when covered by Elvis Presley in 1956. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Mama+Thornton/_/Hound+Dog\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
